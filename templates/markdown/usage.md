To use {{ project_name }}, you need to install it into the game folder following the instructions below.
Once installed, {{ project_name }} is automatically loaded by a game every time you launch the game.
{{ project_name }} supports **2** installation modes: _Hook mode_ and _Proxy mode_.

### ↔️ Mode comparison

#### 🪝 Hook mode

- **Advantages**:
    - Persists after game updates
    - Can be loaded by other injectors
    - Can sometimes bypass DLL integrity checks
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Might need an additional DLL to get injected (like [Koaloader])

#### 🔀 Proxy mode

- **Advantages**:
    - Guaranteed to load
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Might need reinstallation aftera game update

My advice is to try installing the unlocker in hook mode first.
If it doesn't work, try installing it in proxy mode instead.
If that didn't work, refer to the _Troubleshooting_ section below.
